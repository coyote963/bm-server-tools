# Boring Man TUI

Boring Man TUI is a terminal based admin dashboard for boring man servers, built using python's `rich` library.

It displays useful information for server admins such as scoreboard, killfeed, in game chat and other useful information.

Still very much a work in progress.

    `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

2. Run the TUI:

    `python tui.py`

    Fill out IP, Rcon Port and Password of your boring man server
